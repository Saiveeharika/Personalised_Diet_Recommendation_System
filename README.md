Personalised_Diet_Recommendation_System

In today's era of personalized healthcare, the demand for intelligent systems that cater to individual health needs is ever-increasing. This project presents an innovative approach to a diet recommendation system that integrates Flask backend technology with machine learning algorithms to provide personalized suggestions based on user input regarding symptoms, disease characterization, and overall health management.

Project Overview

The system starts by collecting user symptoms through an intuitive web interface built using Flask. By leveraging a Support Vector Classifier (SVC), the system analyzes this input to:

- Characterize symptoms  
- Identify potential diseases or nutritional deficiencies  
- Recommend personalized diet plans  
- Suggest suitable workout routines  
- Provide relevant precautions and medications

Technology Stack

- Backend: Flask  
- Machine Learning: Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS (with integration to Flask)  
- Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy  
- Model Training: Scikit-learn

Features

- Interactive web interface for user symptom input  
- Disease and deficiency prediction based on symptom analysis  
- Personalized diet recommendations  
- Suggested workouts based on health conditions  
- Health precautions and medication suggestions

Backend Workflow

The Flask backend manages:  
- User request handling  
- Data processing and validation  
- Model inference and recommendation logic  
- Serving results back to the user in a user-friendly format

It ensures efficient communication between the user interface and the machine learning model, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.

Goal
The goal is to support individuals in maintaining a healthier lifestyle by offering personalized, data-driven insights and actionable recommendations based on their specific health conditions.
