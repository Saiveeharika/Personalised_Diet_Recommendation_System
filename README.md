# Personalised_Diet_Recommendation_System
In today's era of personalized healthcare, the demand for intelligent systems that cater to individual health needs is ever-increasing. This Project proposes a novel approach to a diet recommendation system that integrates Flask backend technology with machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recommendations based on user input regarding symptoms, disease characterization, and health management. 
The system begins by collecting user input of symptoms through an intuitive web interface built on the Flask backend. Leveraging machine learning algorithm- Support Vector Classifier, the system analyses this input to characterize symptoms, identify potential diseases or nutritional deficiencies, and recommend personalized diet plans, workout routines, precautions, and medication.
The Flask backend serves as the backbone of the system, handling data processing, model inference, and recommendation generation in a scalable and efficient manner. It ensures seamless communication between the front-end user interface and the machine learning components, providing a smooth user experience.
The system integrates precautions and proper medication recommendations based on disease characterization, ensuring comprehensive health management.
